In this assigment, we have created two separate scripts - one alanyzes the financial records of a company and the second one analyzes votes. Findings are discussed below

# Findings
1 - Financial analysis
The following information is generated about the financial records of the company:
* The analysis is for a period of 86 months in total
* The net profit/losses over this period of time
* The average change in profit/losses
* The greatest increase and decrease in profits during this period

2- Couting votes
The following information is generated from the votes casted in a small rural town:
* Total number of votes
* List of candidates who received votes
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* total number of votes each candidate won
* the winner

  
# Limitations
The second script fails to show the total number of votes and the percentage of votes each candidate won. It also fails to show the winner based on maximim vote count.


# References
Tutorial youtube videos and google searches were used as references in writing both scripts.
Tutor support and guidance was used to export a text file with the results of the analysis.
